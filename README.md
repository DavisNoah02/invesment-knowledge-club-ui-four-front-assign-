# Investment Knowledge Club - Frontend Assessment

### Project Overview

This project is a re-creation of a membership selection interface for an investment knowledge club. The goal was to build a fully responsive, clean, and interactive UI based on provided design requirements.
### Project Source

The requirements for this assessment were provided in the official [Frontend Submission.pdf](/reference-doc/Frontend%20Submission.pdf) located in the `reference` folder of this repo.

### Features

-   **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first layout that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using the Bootstrap grid system.
    
-   **Interactive Membership Cards**: Users can click on the "Foundation" or "Economy" membership headers to reveal or hide their respective service descriptions.
   
    
-   **Clean Code**: Organized structure with a clear separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    

### Tech Stack

-   **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
    
-   **CSS3**: For custom styling and transitions.
    
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: To handle the toggle interactivity and basic logic.
    
-   **Bootstrap 5**: Utilizes for the grid system and core UI components.
